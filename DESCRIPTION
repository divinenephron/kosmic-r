Description: Kosmic estimates the distribution of physiological results from a mixture of physiological
             and pathological results, like those that are found in laboratory databases. It does this
             by appying a Box-Cox transformation, then fitting a gaussian distribution to a truncated
             part of the data. The estimated distribution can be used to calculated a reference interval.
